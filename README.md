# 2BHK-Home-Design
The plan shows a well-organized 2BHK house with two large bedrooms, a spacious living hall, kitchen, bathrooms, and additional rooms like a puja room, guest room, office room, and store room. The zoning is properly divided into private spaces (bedrooms) and common areas (hall &amp; kitchen).
Here is a **clear explanation of your 2BHK Portfolio PDF** including **Source, Tools Used, Input, Output, Revit Workflow, and Coloring** (based on your uploaded BIM Portfolio ):

# 📘 PROJECT EXPLANATION – 2BHK DESIGN (BIM PORTFOLIO)

---

## 1️⃣ Source of Project

The source of this project is a **Residential 2BHK Building Design** created for:

* Academic / Portfolio purpose
* BIM modeling practice
* Architectural planning & visualization

The design includes:

* Floor Plan (Top View)
* 3D View
* Front View
* Back View
* Section Views
* Room Color Legend

---

## 2️⃣ Tools Used

### 🛠 Software Tools:

* **Autodesk Revit** – For 3D BIM Modeling
* **AutoCAD** – For drafting (if CAD to BIM used)
* **Escape (Enscape)** – For Rendering & Walkthrough
* **BIM 360 (Knowledge Level)** – For collaboration understanding

### 🔧 Revit Tools Used:

* Wall Tool
* Door & Window Tool
* Floor Tool
* Roof by Footprint
* Room & Room Tags
* Color Scheme (Rooms)
* Section Tool
* 3D View
* View Templates
* Sheet Creation

---

## 3️⃣ Input of Project

The inputs required to create this 2BHK model:

### 📐 Architectural Inputs:

* Room dimensions
* Wall thickness (230mm external, 115mm internal)
* Door & window sizes
* Floor height
* Plot size

### 📊 BIM Inputs:

* Room parameters
* Area calculations
* LOD level (Level of Development)
* Materials
* Family creation (Parametric & Non-parametric)

---

## 4️⃣ Output of Project

The final outputs generated from Revit:

✅ 2D Floor Plan
✅ 3D Model
✅ Elevations (Front & Back View)
✅ Section Views
✅ Room Area Schedule
✅ Color-filled presentation plan
✅ Rendered view for portfolio

These outputs are used for:

* Construction documentation
* Client presentation
* Portfolio submission
* Academic evaluation

---

## 5️⃣ Revit Workflow (Step-by-Step)

1. Set Project Units
2. Create Levels
3. Draw Walls (External & Internal)
4. Add Doors & Windows
5. Create Floor & Roof
6. Place Rooms & Tag
7. Generate Sections & Elevations
8. Apply Materials
9. Use Room Color Scheme
10. Create Sheets & Export to PDF

---

## 6️⃣ Revit Coloring (Room Color Scheme)

In your project, coloring is applied using:

**Revit → Architecture → Room → Color Scheme**

Each room is assigned different colors for clarity:

* 🟢 Emerald Green – Office Room
* 🟤 Olive Brown – WC
* 🟡 Pastel Lime – Bedroom 1
* 🟡 Chartreuse Green – Bedroom 2
* 🟣 Magenta – Hall
* 🔵 Turquoise – Kitchen
* 🟨 Light Lemon Yellow – Store
* 🟫 Terracotta – Bathroom

### Purpose of Coloring:

* Easy room identification
* Better visualization
* Area zoning clarity
* Professional presentation
